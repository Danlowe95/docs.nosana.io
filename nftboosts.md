## Burner Phones

Burner Phones are the official NFT collection by Nosana. Holding a Burner Phone is required to access the Nosana mainnet and gives you access to dedicated community channels. Next to that, individual Burner Phones can hold special boosts. Let‚Äôs explore!

### Boosts

A boost is a special ability that you get when holding a specific Burner Phone. Boosts can have various levels and correspond to a visual element of your NFT. 

### Priority Queue

This boost allows nodes to skip places in the Nodes Queue. This means your node will be able to get jobs quicker. Sounds a bit unfair, that‚Äôs why this boost will be rare. Wait less and earn more $NOS!

### Discount

With the discount boost you will pay less $NOS fees for posting a new job. This boost will be very valuable for power users that need a lot of compute. A lifetime discount to the Nosana platform. Think of it. Wow!

### Extra tickets

Holding this boost will give you more tickets in all future raffles that use the ticket system. Time to get lucky! üçÄ
