# Introduction

Welcome to the Nosana Network! Let us give you an introduction to Nosana and her vision

## What is Nosana?

Nosana is changing the way the world accesses and utilizes computing power. They are providing a distributed GPU grid that allows anyone to rent compute power without the usual overhead, excessive fees, or lock-in. Nosana is addressing the shortage of GPUs in the market, making it easier for companies to get access to the necessary hardware. They are also taking advantage of underutilized hardware, such as gaming PCs, miners, and MacBooks, and offering competitive prices for building and running AI-solutions. This makes Nosana an ideal choice for those looking for a reliable and affordable computing solution.

## What Nosana Offers

Nosana is a platform that provides AI users with affordable GPUs and GPU owners with an income. GPU owners can rent their GPUs to AI users, who in turn can access powerful hardware and train and use their models faster. Nosana also provides users with a powerful suite of tools to help them get the most out of their GPU resources. With easy-to-use APIs and flexible pricing options, Nosana makes it easier than ever to access the power of AI.

## Ultimate Vision

We aim to bring the disruptive power of blockchain technology to the field of AI.

As we move toward a future that is more decentralized, our **ultimate vision** is that projects will not rely on centralized mega-corporations for their daily operations. We believe that communities can perform essential computations in a decentralized manner by utilizing the Nosana Network. With Nosana, a robust community has the ability to keep any project running forever.
