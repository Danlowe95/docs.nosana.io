# Roadmap

Welcome to the journey of Nosana, a platform that to powers the AI revolution by creating the world's largest distributed GPU network. Our mission is to democratize access to powerful computational resources, and our roadmap outlines the key stages of our growth. The journey is divided into five major release cycles, each named after a galaxy symbolizing our quest to explore the vast universe of possibilities.

1. **Genesis**: The birth of our platform, a stage of rigorous testing and refining.
2. **Galactica**: The expansion phase when we open up our network to the public.
3. **Triangulum**: Our step towards increased interoperability, integrating with major machine learning protocols.
4. **Whirlpool**: Where we broaden our horizon, supporting a diverse array of GPU types.
5. **Sombrero**: Our commitment to cater to businesses of all sizes, introducing financial and collaborative features.

At every stage, we focus on different aspects of our platform, aiming to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly GPU network. We eagerly anticipate the journey ahead and invite you to join us as we push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Release cycles

### Genesis (v0.0 - H2 2023)

This is the launch of the platform, including alpha and beta stages. It will involve bootstrapping the network of GPUs and replicating demand > supplier > demand throughput to test the system end-to-end. This will involve testing the system, onboarding early users, and collecting feedback for improvements. During this phase, the focus will be on ensuring stability, reliability, and performance of the platform.

### Galactica (v1.0 - H1/H2 2024)

The second phase will see the main grid going live. The CLI and SDK will be released, allowing any GPU to join the network. This will also include the launch of a Container Node for consumer GPUs. During this phase, the focus will be on scaling up the network and engaging with a larger user base.

### Triangulum (v1.X - H2 2024)

This release will focus on integrating with major machine learning protocols. The Community Connector Library will be launched, along with official connectors for PyTorch, HuggingFace, TensorFlow, and others. The goal during this phase will be to increase the platform's usability and compatibility with existing machine learning tools and libraries.

### Whirlpool (v1.X - H1 2025)

This release will expand the platform's reach even further by supporting a more diverse array of GPUs, including those from AMD, Intel, and Apple's M2 and M3 chips. The aim will be to turn Nosana into the world's largest compute grid. This phase will involve significant technical challenges, as it will require ensuring the platform can handle a wide variety of hardware and use cases.

### Sombrero (v1.X - H2 2025)

This release will add support for small and medium-sized businesses, introduce fiat currency ramping, billing, and teams. This phase will involve not only technical development but also business and community development, as the platform will need to attract and support a wider range of users and use cases.
