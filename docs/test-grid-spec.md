# Test Grid Spec - Phase 1

Welcome to the Nosana Test Grid Phase 1! This document contains everything you need to know before you participate. 

## Markets

For the duration of the first Test Grid, you will be assigned to a market with similar devices. The instructions in your email contain details about your market access key and how to connect with it. If you have not received this email yet please be patient, it should arrive within the first week. You should not switch to a different market unless requested to do so by the Nosana team.

## Rewards

During the Test Grid, you will get paid in NOS for the computations you perform while running jobs as a Nosana Node. Additional rewards can be earned by completing certain challenges. The reward specification sheet with all the details can be found in the [Test Grid Reward Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WtRZNaNKgFJ66fGUwmd-ESC-ye8mRa9Qi49RZNvd-YE/edit#gid=0).

All rewards are paid out in NOS tokens. The rewards listed in euros are converted to NOS at the market rate specified after the Test Grid.

::: note
The rewards are subject are subject to change, and can be updated by Nosana to reflect market conditions, improve fairness, or for any other reason.
:::

### Compute Job Rewards
For processing compute jobs on your GPU, you will be rewarded with a certain amount of NOS per second. The amount you earn depends on your GPU model. These rewards are paid out immediately upon completion and can be freely transferred.

Note that job earnings are subsidized for the Test Grid and are higher than during normal operations. Also, there will be periods during Test Grid where your GPU is idle and does not earn rewards.

::: note
- To earn rewards, you must run a Nosana node and let it successfully do compute jobs
- You only earn rewards while processing compute jobs. During idle times, your GPU is not utilized and you will not earn rewards.
- Compute Rewards are directly transferred to your nodeâ€™s Solana account 
:::

### Additional Rewards

There are multiple tasks that can be completed for additional rewards, like sharing your experience on social networks or publishing educational content. These rewards are paid out at the end of the Test Grid and are subject to several conditions: 

::: warning
- You must perform the KYC process through our portal.
- You may not be a resident of one of the [OFAC restricted countries](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).
- The amount is linearly unlocked over a period of 31 days starting at the end of the Test Grid.
- You will get access to our vesting portal, where vested tokens can be claimed at any time.
- You must have completed at least 14 compute jobs on the Test Grid.
- The additional tasks are subject to approval by the Nosana team.
:::

If the requirements are not met, we will not be able to pay out additional rewards.

Refer to the [Test Grid Reward Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WtRZNaNKgFJ66fGUwmd-ESC-ye8mRa9Qi49RZNvd-YE/edit#gid=0) for details payment of tasks.
