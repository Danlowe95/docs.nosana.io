# Getting Started

The Nosana Network is a platform for running AI inference workloads. This section provides an introduction to the platform and how to get started. Firstly, you will need to obtain `$NOS` tokens, which can be obtained on [different places](https://nosana.io/token). Once you have NOS tokens, you can then start running AI inference workloads, such as [LLama 2](llama) and [generative models](generative). This section holds detailed documentation to help you set up your workloads quickly and easily.
