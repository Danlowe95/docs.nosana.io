# Nosana Jobs <Badge type="tip" text="mainnet" vertical="middle" />

The Nosana Jobs program allows projects to post pipeline jobs.
It allows nodes in the Nosana Network to earn tokens by running those jobs.

## Accounts

A number of 2 account types make for the Nosana Job programs' state.

### Nodes Account

The `NodesAccount` struct holds all the information about jobs and the nodes queue.

```rust
pub struct NodesAccount {
    pub job_price: u64,
    pub job_timeout: i64,
    pub job_type: u8,
    pub vault: Pubkey,
    pub vault_bump: u8,
    pub queue: Vec<Pubkey>,
}
```

### Job Account

The `JobAccount` struct holds all the information about any invidual jobs.

```rust
pub struct JobAccount {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub ipfs_job: [u8; 32],
    pub ipfs_result: [u8; 32],
    pub node: Pubkey,
    pub nodes: Pubkey,
    pub status: u8,
    pub time_start: i64,
    pub time_end: i64,
}
```

## Instructions

A number of 8 instruction are defined in the Nosana Staking program.
To load the program with [Anchor](https://coral-xyz.github.io/anchor/ts/index.html) in `TypeScript`:

```typescript
const programId = new PublicKey('nosJhNRqr2bc9g1nfGDcXXTXvYUmxD4cVwy2pMWhrYM');
const idl = await Program.fetchIdl(programId.toString());
const program = new Program(idl, programId);
```

### Init

The `init()` instruction initializes a nodes queue and a associated token vault for token deposits.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .init(
        jobPrice,
        jobTimeout,
        jobType,
    )
    .accounts({
        mint,
        nodes,
        vault,
        authority,
        rent,
        systemProgram,
        tokenProgram,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

### Create

The `create()` instruction creates a Job with it's required data.
When there is a node ready in the queue it will immediately start running.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .init(ipfsJob)
    .accounts({
        job,
        nodes,
        vault,
        user,
        authority,
        rent,
        systemProgram,
        tokenProgram,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

### Close

The `close()` instruction closes an existing job account.
When the job was still queued the tokens will be returned to the user.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .close()
    .accounts({
        job,
        nodes,
        vault,
        user,
        authority,
        tokenProgram,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

### Enter

With the `enter()` instruction a node enters the node queue.

A few requirements are enforced:

- A node needs to have a minimum stake in Nosana Staking.
- A node needs to hold an official Nosana NFT.
- A node can only enter the queue once

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .enter()
    .accounts({
        stake,
        nft,
        metadata,
        nodes,
        vault,
        authority,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

### Exit

With the `exit()` instruction a node exits the node queue.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .exit()
    .accounts({
        nodes,
        authority,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

### Claim

With the `claim()` instruction a node can claim a job that is in the queued state.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .claim()
    .accounts({
        job,
        stake,
        nft,
        metadata,
        nodes,
        vault,
        authority,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

To find unclaimed jobs with anchor:

```javascript
const jobs = await this.jobsProgram.account.jobAccount.all([
  {
    memcmp: {
      /** offset into program account data to start comparison */
      offset: 96,
      /** data to match, as base-58 encoded string and limited to less than 129 bytes */
      bytes: this.accounts.systemProgram.toBase58(),
    },
  },
]);
```

### Cancel

With the `cancel()` instruction a node can stop running a job that it has started.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .cancel()
    .accounts({
        job,
        authority,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```

### Finish

With the `finish()` instruction a node can can post the result for a job it has finished, and me reimbursed for the work.

```typescript
let tx = await program.methods
    .finish()
    .accounts({
        job,
        nodes,
        vault,
        user,
        authority,
        tokenProgram,
    })
    .signers([authorityKey])
    .rpc();
```
