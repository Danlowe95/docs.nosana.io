# Introduction

Nosana Programs are build using the
[Solana Programming Model](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview),
in combination the [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).

We use Anchor because we can build Solana Programs quicker. It handles things like
the (de)serialization of Solana Account and Instruction data.
It also handles certain security checks.
For example, it allows us to define additional security checks on account data,
and keep this separate from your Nosana Network accounts and instruction logic.

Find all the Nosana Programs in our open source [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nosana-ci/nosana-programs/).

## Get started

To get yourself ready with `rust`, `solana`, and `anchor`, we recommend
[Anchor's installation guide](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation).

Happy coding!
