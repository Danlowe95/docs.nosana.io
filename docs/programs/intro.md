# Introduction

Nosana Programs are built using the
[Solana Programming Model](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview),
with the help of the [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).

We use Anchor to build Solana Programs. It takes care of things like
the (de)serialization of Solana Account and instruction data.
It also handles certain security checks.
For example, it allows us to define additional checks on account data,
and keep them separate from the Nosana Network accounts and instruction logic.

Our open source [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nosana-ci/nosana-programs/)  has all the Nosana programs.

## Get started

To get yourself ready with `rust`, `solana`, and `anchor`, we recommend
[Anchor's installation guide](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation).

Happy coding!
