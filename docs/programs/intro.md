# Introduction

Nosana Programs are build using the
[Solana Programming Model](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview),
with the help of the [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).

We use Anchor to build Solana Programs. It handles things like
the (de)serialization of Solana Account and Instruction data.
It also handles certain security checks.
For example, it allows us to define additional checks on account data,
and keep this separate from the Nosana Network accounts and instruction logic.

Find all the Nosana Programs in our open source [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nosana-ci/nosana-programs/).

## Get started

To get yourself ready with `rust`, `solana`, and `anchor`, we recommend
[Anchor's installation guide](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation).

Happy coding!
