# Getting Started
## GPU Test Grid
Welcome to the GPU Test Grid, a platform designed to validate our GPU grid across a diverse array of GPU devices. With comprehensive feedback and proactive issue resolution as our core objective, we are on the path to a smooth transition to the mainnet. We extend an open invitation to developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts to be part of this exciting journey. By joining the test grid and assisting us in running AI models, you'll also get the opportunity to participate in our reward distribution pool. For phase 1, we have allocated a substantial pool of 250,000 $NOS tokens. Together, let's shape the future of GPU testing and development.

## Nosana Node
The Nosana Node is the software that you run to connect your hardware to the Grid.
In order to register for the Test Grid, you'll need to run a Nosana Node with a NVIDIA GPU.

::: warning

At the moment the Nosana Node is in pre-release. Therefore we highly recommend to run this in a clean environment or virtual machine, and to use a Solana address with only a minimal amount of SOL.

<!-- ## Software Requirements
You will need to install the following to get started with a Nosana Node:

- [Ubuntu (>20.04) or Windows (with Ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#3-download-ubuntu)
- [Docker (Required)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/)
  - [Podman (Optional - Required for WSL2)](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=devel%3Akubic%3Alibcontainers%3Aunstable&package=podman)
- [NVIDIA Drivers (Required)](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-nvidia-driver-ubuntu)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Required)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
- [Solana Tool Suite (Optional)](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) -->

## Installation guides

These guides are instructing you on how to establish your Nosana Node and partake in the Test Grid. The choice of guide depends on your operating system:

1. [Windows (WSL2)](/nodes/testgrid-windows): This guide is suitable for you if you're running Windows. WSL2 stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, which allows you to run Linux on your Windows machine. Following this guide, you'll be able to set up your Nosana Node within this environment.

2. [Ubuntu](/nodes/testgrid-ubuntu): If you're running Ubuntu, a popular distribution of Linux, you should follow this guide.
