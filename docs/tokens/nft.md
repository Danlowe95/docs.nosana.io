## Certified Collection

Certified Collections enables NFTs – and tokens in general — to be grouped together and for that information
to be verified on-chain.
Additionally, it makes it easier to manage these collections by allocating data for them on-chain.

It allows the Nosana Network to verify NFT holders onchain.
For example, in the [Nosana Jobs Program](programs/jobs) nodes are required to hold an Nosana NFT
to qualify for running pipelines.

Attributes allow us to define custom properties (key/value pairs) that describe the Nosana NFT.
These attributes are displayed when viewing the NFT in your wallet or marketplace of choice.
