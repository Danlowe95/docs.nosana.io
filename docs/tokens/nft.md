# Nosana NFT

Now, we’ve got our very own collection, consisting of 850 Burner Phone NTFs that exist on the Solana Blockchain.
Think of a Burner Phone NFT as your very own Network membership card.
It even comes with owner-only perks, which you can access on the Nosana Network, the Metaverse or at home.

## Certified Collection

Certified Collections enables NFTs – and tokens in general — to be grouped together and for that information
to be verified on-chain.
Additionally, it makes it easier to manage these collections by allocating data for them on-chain.

It allows the Nosana Network to verify NFT holders onchain.
For example, in the [Nosana Jobs Program](programs/jobs) nodes are required to hold an Nosana NFT
to qualify for running pipelines.
