## Certified Collection

![](https://arweave.net/mMBKQ4GAJtAAh8fMRMiFOmQhozbLVxIbCe0ZBeioERc){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

Certified Collections enables NFTs ‚Äì and tokens in general ‚Äî to be grouped together and for that information
to be verified on-chain.
Additionally, it makes it easier to manage these collections by allocating data for them on-chain.

It allows the Nosana Network to verify NFT holders on-chain.
For example, in the [Nosana Jobs Program](programs/jobs) nodes are required to hold an Nosana NFT
to qualify for running pipelines.
