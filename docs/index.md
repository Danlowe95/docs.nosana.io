  - title: Decentralized Marketplace
    details: Nosana Network is a peer-to-peer marketplace for CPU computations. Big tech companies run millions of CI/CD pipelines every day. With Nosana, we’re offering a more affordable, more accessible, and more sustainable alternative to centralized cloud solutions. How? By putting the spare capacity of the masses to work.
  - title: Better for the planet
    details: The computational needs of our tech-driven world are hard on our planet. Computational resources are used inefficiently, causing even more problems. We use what’s already there. Our decentralized cloud solution is powered by spare computing resources. Much better for the environment.
  - title: Opportunities for everyone
    details: With Nosana, we’re creating opportunities for everyone. That includes people with lower incomes or those from developing countries. For example, charities could donate unused devices to help families generate income.
